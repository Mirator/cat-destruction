# Multi-Room Implementation Plan (Free Navigation)

## 1. Room Class Creation
**File:** `src/objects/room/Room.js`
- Extract room creation logic from `mainScene.js`
- Room class will create a THREE.Group containing all room elements
- Include position parameters so rooms can be placed adjacent to each other
- Allow for open doorways or passages between rooms

## 2. Room Layout Manager
**File:** `src/objects/room/RoomLayoutManager.js`
- Manage the physical arrangement of multiple rooms in 3D space
- Position rooms adjacent to each other (side by side, not overlapping)
- Create open passages between rooms where appropriate
- All rooms will exist in the scene simultaneously

## 3. Update Main Scene
**File:** `src/scenes/mainScene.js`
- Refactor to create multiple Room instances
- Position rooms according to a logical layout (e.g., one room to the left of another)
- Add all room groups to the scene at once
- Update camera controls to allow free movement between rooms

## 4. Player Movement System
- Ensure player can move freely between rooms
- Adjust collision detection to handle all room boundaries
- Consider camera adjustments when moving between rooms

## 5. Game Object Management
- Cat and food objects will exist across all rooms
- Allow cat to wander between rooms (optional)
- Food placement can happen in any room

## 6. Visual Differentiators
- Ensure each room has distinct visual characteristics
- Different wall colors, floor patterns, or furniture arrangements
- Consider different lighting for each room

## 7. Room Configuration
**File:** `src/config/RoomConfig.js`
- Expand room configuration to support multiple room variations
- Include layout parameters for positioning rooms relative to each other

## 8. Optimization
- Consider frustum culling or other techniques for performance
- Only render/update rooms that are visible to the camera
- Minimize unnecessary physics calculations for distant rooms

## 9. Testing
- Test player movement between rooms
- Verify game mechanics function properly across room boundaries
- Ensure cat and objects behave consistently throughout the space
